# calculator

This project was really fun to complete. The design for this calculator was inspired by the calculator on my andriod phone.
I decided to add features like factorial,pi, square, square root, exponent, percentage, decimal and a delete button!

The fact that I was able to figure out the functions and populate the calculator display with it made me happy.

This marks the last project of the foundations course and so being able to make this project proved myself my skills, which makes me feel grateful.
